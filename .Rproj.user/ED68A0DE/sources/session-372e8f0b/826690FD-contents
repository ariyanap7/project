<!-- Short Description  -->
This project uses collected data from camera trap videos documenting visits from multiple hummingbird species to the plant Zingiber spectabile in order to analyze pollinator patterns in invasive plant species. The purpose of statistical analysis of this prior data within this project is to observe behavioral feeding patterns in Router hummingbird species versus Territorial hummingbird species.

*Updated on `r Sys.time()`*
